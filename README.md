## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git`
    `cd your-repository-name`

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    `python -m venv venv`

    * **Activate on Windows:**
        `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    * **Activate on macOS/Linux:**
        `source venv/bin/activate`

3.  **Install required libraries:**
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Usage Instructions: Once everything is installed, how do they run the tool?
Markdown

## Usage

After activating the virtual environment and installing all dependencies, you can run your tool's main script:

`python main.py`

(Replace `main.py` if your main file has a different name.)

If your tool takes command-line arguments, mention them here:
`python main.py --symbol AAPL --period 1y`
Examples: Provide some code snippets or screenshots to show how the tool works.
Contributing (if you accept contributions): If people want to improve your code, how should they do it?
License: What is the license for your code (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0)?
b. Keep Your requirements.txt File Updated
Your project should have a requirements.txt file listing all the Python libraries your tool uses. Whenever you add a new library, update this file:

Bash

pip freeze > requirements.txt
This command saves all installed libraries and their versions from your virtual environment into the requirements.txt file. This helps others run your project in the exact same environment you developed it in.

2. How Others Can Use Your Tool
When someone lands on your GitHub repository, they'll read your README.md file. They'll then follow these steps:

Clone the repository: They'll download your GitHub repository to their local computer.
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
Navigate to the directory: They'll move into the project's directory.
Bash

cd your-repository-name
Create and activate a virtual environment: They'll create a new virtual environment and activate it. This prevents your project's dependencies from interfering with their system's Python installation.
Bash

python -m venv venv
# Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies: They'll install all the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file.
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the tool: Finally, they can run your Python script as instructed in your README.md.
Bash

python your_main_file.py
